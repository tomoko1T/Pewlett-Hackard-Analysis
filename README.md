# How to overcome Silver Tsunami!

## Overview of the analysis:

This analysis was conducted for Pewlett Hackard to be prepared for "silver tsunami" which is upcoming wave of the retirements.  There are the number of retirements who would need the retirement package and leave many job opening positions.  A list of all eligible employees for the retirement package and future opening position were generated by the earlier reseach.  

Now the following two assigments were ordered:
 - Determine the number of retiring employees per title
 - Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:     
 
* Total number of retiree is 72,458 which indicates the number of future opening positions.  
* Almost 70% of the retirees are acounted by Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.
* Total eligible employees for memtorship program are only 1,549 which is significantly lower number than the retirees.  
* Pewlett Hackard may not be ready for Silver Tsunami based on the number 72,458 retirees vs 1,549 current eligible employees for memtorship program.

## Summary 

There are 7 roles will need to be filled.  By conducting the additional analysis for the eligible employees for mentorship by title, there are only 6 roles.  The table on the right side below shows that none of those employee is at manager position.  It would be necessary to have the empolyees at other potision to be trained for the manager position as well.

There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  As mentioned in the result section above, the number of retirees is much higher than the number of the eligible employees for mentorsship program.  Thus, it is necessary to look for current employees who who were born later than 1965 as well.  However, the current employee data has only the information people who were born before 1965.  The further data collection is highly recommended to expand the mentorship program eligibility.
