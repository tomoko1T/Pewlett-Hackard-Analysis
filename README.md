# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

This analysis was conducted for Pewlett Hackard to be prepared for "silver tsunami" which is upcoming wave of the retirements.  There are the number of retirements who would need the retirement package and leave many job opening positions.  A list of all eligible employees for the retirement package and future opening position were generated by the earlier reseach.  

Now the following two assigments were ordered:
 - Determine the number of retiring employees per title
 - Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Results:     Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

total retirees 72458 
* Almost 70% of the retirees are acounted by Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions.
* number of eligible emplyoees are much lower than retirees so need to hire or open more




The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight. (5 pt)
